# LogJuicer Extracts Anomalies From Log Files

Based on baseline logs, LogJuicer highlights useful texts in target logs.
The goal is to save time in finding failures' root causes.


## How it works

LogJuicer implements a custom diffing process to compare logs:

* A tokenizer removes random words.
* Lines are converted into feature vectors using the hashing trick.
* The logs are compared using cosine similarity.


## Install

Install the `logjuicer` command line by running:

```
$ cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/logjuicer/logjuicer logjuicer-cli
```

> If you don't have `cargo`, see this [install rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install) documentation.

Or grab the latest release assets `logjuicer-x86_64-linux.tar.bz2` from <https://github.com/logjuicer/logjuicer/releases>


## Use

Analyze a local file:

```ShellSession
$ logjuicer path /var/log/zuul/scheduler.log
```

Analyze a remote url:

```ShellSession
$ logjuicer url https://zuul/build/uuid
```

Compare two inputs (when baseline discovery doesn't work):

```ShellSession
$ logjuicer diff https://zuul/build/success-build https://zuul/build/failed-build
```

Save and re-use trained model using the `--model file-path` argument.


## Configure

LogJuicer supports the [ant's fileset](https://ant.apache.org/manual/Types/fileset.html) configuration to
filter the processed files:

- *includes*: list of files regex that must be included. Defaults to all files.
- *excludes*: list of files regex that must be excluded. Defaults to default excludes or none if `default_excludes` is false.
- *default_excludes*: indicates whether [default excludes](./crates/model/src/config/default_excludes.rs) should be used or not.

## Contribute

Clone the project and run tests:

```
git clone https://github.com/logjuicer/logjuicer && cd logjuicer
cargo test && cargo fmt && cargo clippy
```

Run the project:

```
cargo run -p logjuicer-cli -- --help
```

Activate tracing debug:

```
export LOGJUICER_LOG="logjuicer_model=debug,logjuicer_cli=debug"
# Create a chrome trace that can be viewed in web browser with `chrome://tracing`
export LOGJUICER_TRACE=./chrome.trace
```
