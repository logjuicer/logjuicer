# 0002. Architecture of the logjuicer-service

* Status: proposed
* Date: 2022-03-16
* Deciders: Fabien Boucher, Tristan de Cacqueray

The goal of this document is to list the main use-cases of the logjuicer service.

## Context and Problem Statement

We would like to provide better feedbacks by looking for similarities between reports and correlate the issues.
In particular for transient issues such as infra failures or broken third-party CI,
logjuicer needs to report links to known issues instead of the full report.

For example, in the case of a third party CI, when a breaking change is merged, then further jobs are likely to fail with the same anomaly.
In that situation, we would like the first failure to have a tracking issue, for example in bugzilla.
Then further reports with similar content should be linked to the issue.


## Considered Options

* [option 1] Focus on the third-parcy CI use-case.
* [option 2] Define the near future goals and implements the main use-case accordingly.

## Decision Outcome

Chosen option: "[option 1]", because it comes out best (see below).
We focus on the most valuable feature and we will tackle further improvements (such as elastic recheck or dashboard for tripleo jobs) in the future.

## Service Use Cases

### Improve third-party CI efficiency

Here is the sequence of action that we would like to support:

- First MR on `rpms/openssh` removes a command line flag used by the ansible project.
- A report is produced for the ansible third-party CI which contains `ssh: unknown command line flag`
- The MR is merged.

- A second MR on `rpms/glibc` is proposed.
- The ansible third-party CI fails with the same error `ssh: unknown command line flag`
- The developper submit the issue because it is unrelated to the MR opened on the glibc.
- A new tracking issue is created: `rhbz#42 openssh version XX is incompatible for ansible because it removed command line flag YY`

- Further ansible third-party CI failures that matches this transient error will not produce a report, but instead they will link the tracking issue.


Here is a set of service features to support this use-case:


### Create tracking issue

When the anomalies reported are unrelated to the build, for example when it's a infra failure, they can be uploaded to the logjuicer-service so that a tracking issue is created.
The recipient may be able to annotate the report with a title:

```haskell
submitIssue  :: ApiURL -> (Source, [Anomaly]) -> Title -> IO ReportID
```

Note that the cpu intensive analysis happens at the edge, where the build failed, so that the service is only in charge of indexing the reports.


### Triage dashboard

CI operator can triage submitted reports:

```haskell
getSubmittedIssues  :: ApiURL -> IO [ReportID]
validateIssue       :: ApiURL -> ReportID -> IO BugID
```

Validating an issue means that a tracking issue (on a bug tracker) is created and further report may be linked to this initial submission.
This step is used to sanity check the issue is relevant.


### Issue dashboard

The list of known issues may be visible through a dashboard:

```haskell
listValidatedIssues :: ApiURL -> IO [(BugID, Title)]
```


### Query for existing issue

After a report is produced, logjuicer-cli may query the service to check if it matches known issues:

- When a known issue matches, a link to the issue is reported. For example `rhbz#42 - package X is causing segfault`.
- If the issue is closed, then a comment may be added to the issue to indicate a new occurance.

```haskell
checkReport :: Report -> IO (Maybe [BugID])
```


### Submit helpful report

Moreover, the service may be used to enrich the logjuicer-tests dataset.
When a report contains helpful anomalies, it can also be uploaded so that it is added to the logjuicer-tests dataset.
The logjuicer-tests dataset are used for tokenizer and model implementation to prevent regression.

This logjuicer-tests dataset is valuable on its own as it provide test data to implement such service.
It contains baseline and annotated target.
